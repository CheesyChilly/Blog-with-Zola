## **About Me🫡**

>***“Half web developer 💻, half cybersecurity nerd 🔐, full-time bug wrangler.”***

I’m someone who **builds things on the web** and then spends equal amounts of time **making sure they don’t get broken into**. Think of me as the person who designs the shiny digital shop front and double-checks the locks on the back door.

On the web development side, I enjoy turning messy ideas into clean, functional websites that don’t just work, but actually make sense (*most of the time*). On the cybersecurity side, I like to poke at systems the way a cat pokes at a suspicious box—except I’m looking for vulnerabilities, not a mouse.

In short: ***I create, I secure, and I occasionally laugh at my own debugging misery. If you like websites that don’t collapse under pressure and security that doesn’t feel like a 90s password prompt, we’ll get along just fine.***
